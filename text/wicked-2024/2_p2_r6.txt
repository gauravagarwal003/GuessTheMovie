 I hate to be that guy but the color grading on this is hideous. With the production design, costumes, sets, gardens, etc...Every piece of the frame should be BURSTING with vibrant colors. The film crew put all this time and effort into making this movie look and feel magical; Yet they have it looking washed out like grey sludge
