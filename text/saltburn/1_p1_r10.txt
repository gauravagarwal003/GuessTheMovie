 Disappointing that it leaves the audience with absolutely nothing interesting to chew on. All the intrigue over the main character is reduced to an easy answer. The only discernible takeaway you could have from this is that wealth and beauty is something people really want and are drawn to.

That being said it's a pretty fun romp.
