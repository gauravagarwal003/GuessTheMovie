  This movie is funny. This movie is political. This movie is intelligent and wicked and very, very calculated. This movie is sometimes visually stunning, and impeccably acted.But mostly, it's scary as hell.For the love of cinema, do not watch the spoilery-ass trailers. Do not read any reviews unless you trust the reviewers to be circumspect about giving away the plot. Go in as blind as possible and just let the story's surprises unfold. Assuming you're okay with scaryâ€¦
