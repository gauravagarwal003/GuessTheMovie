Spike Lee did a great job of taking an otherwise oversaturated genre and implementing his own twist on it. The general premise and way the story unfolds is very unique and was intriguing to watch, although it does admittedly get slightly overindulgent at times. Thereâ€™s definitely a lot of convoluted plot holes that really hold the film back, but the star power of Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and in particular Denzel is more than enough to make up for it.</p> ", "link": "https://letterboxd.com/haris4pf/film/inside-man/"}
