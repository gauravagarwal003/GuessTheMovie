Ilya KILLS it and Odenkirk is clearly having the time of his life. <br/>Wonderfully shot, edited like a razors edge (EVERLY’s Evan Schiff!), great music choices. <br/>So glad I saw this in the theater to hear people cheering. <br/>Also: Christopher Lloyd and RZA is the spin-off we need ASAP.</p> ", "link": "https://letterboxd.com/thejoelynch/film/nobody-2021/"}
