there's a bit at the start where jake gyllenhaal goes into the bathroom and looks in the mirror and he's got some other guy's face and that must be the most disappointed anyone's ever felt. imagine looking like jake gyllenhaal then suddenly not looking like jake gyllenhaal? Â just looking like some guy. disappointing.
