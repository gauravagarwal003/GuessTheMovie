      "text": " <p>It starts off a bit slow, but once it gets going it’s great. Two great performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. The racing scenes are electric and the score from Hans Zimmer really helps add to them. When it comes to racing movies, I'd rather just watch Ford v Ferrari, but this one is still a great time. </p><p>Ron Howard Ranked</p> ",
