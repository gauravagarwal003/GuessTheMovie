      "text": " <p>As unbelievable as it may sound from me, I must applaud Spielberg's mainstream boldness for bringing to the big screen his last masterpiece: a strong and accurate portrayal of the horrors of the Holocaust. This is Spielberg's attempt to outdo himself, and he is successful at it. Liam Neeson at his best role and a powerful black-and-white cinematography make the tiny probability of the popular opinion, the Academy and my perception to coincide so perfectly, possible.</p><p>96/100</p> ",
