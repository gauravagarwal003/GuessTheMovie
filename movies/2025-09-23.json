      "text": " <p>They spent $200m assembling the most cursed trio of famous people imaginable, who couldn't have less chemistry if they tried, and then let them all explain the heist plot at each other and improv their shticks for 2 hours in front of a camera and called it a movie. An \"original\" movie that is somehow still a generic white noise amalgamation of pretty much every current shitty action-comedy franchise blockbuster trend. Just in case you didn't get what it was going for Ryan Reynolds literally whistles the <i>Indiana Jones</i> theme.</p> ",
