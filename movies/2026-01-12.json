      "text": " <p>The chemistry between Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes was really the best part of this movie. Wish the updated version of the movie also started them as older ball players, but instead they went with new people. Heard it sucked! The OGs never miss and this movie proves it!</p> ",
