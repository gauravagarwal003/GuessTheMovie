      "text": " <p>I love tackling Oscar nominated titles because it helps me reach documentary feats such as this. Something I would find interesting, but not necessarily go out of my way to view. </p><p>This documentary was surprisingly moving, emotional, draining, and extremely inspirational. </p><p>I actually don’t know if I found the free solo climbing itself or Alex’s personality type more interesting. Both were extremely captivating. </p><p>Also, I cannot go without giving major props to the film crew. The amount of patience, emotional attachment, and professional skill eminates through the screen. </p><p>I was relieved to see, even 2 years after the El Cap climb, Alex is still alive.</p> ",
