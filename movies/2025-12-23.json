      "text": " <p>Finally started this trilogy and the first instalment is very, very good. The chemistry is electric, I could honestly just watch them talk about the most pointless shit for hours walking around different settings. Nothing feels forced, you believe the romance and the emotion. Very much looking forward to the second film.</p> ",
