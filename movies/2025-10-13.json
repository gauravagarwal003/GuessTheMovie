      "text": " <p>Felt very uncanny to watch in big 2025. A corrupt administration attacking the press in an effort to conceal their crimes and destroy the public’s faith in meaningful journalism. You’d think with the advent of social media and the chronically online we’d be less forgiving of these cowardly tactics, yet here we are. </p><p>Anyways, that 1-2 combo of Redford and Hoffman is so good, sometimes I forget that the movie also <i>looks</i> incredible. Every frame buzzes with energy.</p> ",
