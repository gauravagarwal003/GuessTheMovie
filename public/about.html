                    <p>Hi, I'm Gaurav. I'm a software developer and avid Letterboxd user (my phone is out and Letterboxd
                        is
                        open as soon as a movie ends). I created this game to combine my love for movies with my passion
                        for
                        coding and to create a fun and engaging experience for fans like me.</p>
                    <p>
                        I'm always open to feedback, ideas, or collaborations. You can email me at
                        <a href="mailto:guessmovielb@gmail.com" class="text-link">guessmovielb@gmail.com</a> or
                        <span style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline;" class="text-link"
                            onclick="displayContactForm()">use this form</span>.
                        If you want to support the project, you can

                            â˜•</a>. Also, I'm looking for people to help with review selection. I handpick all these
                        reviews
                        (NO AI). If you're interested, please reach out!

                    <h2 class="history-about-subheading">How to Play</h2>
                    <p>You have a limited number of tries to guess the movie. Each guess (or skip) will reveal an
                        additional
                        review to help you.</p>
                    <p>To guess, use the search bar and begin typing. You can navigate the list with the arrow keys or
                        cursor and submit your guess with Enter. Use left/right buttons to toggle reviews.</p>
                    <p>Every day features a new movie (added at 12AM EST). Use the archive to play previous days. Gray
                        background = no movie, white = playable movie, green = already played.</p>
                    <p>To save stats and history, play on the same browser/device and avoid incognito or private modes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
